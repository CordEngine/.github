### Reporting Bugs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Please review our [security policy](./SECURITY.md) for information on securely submitting security issues.

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

Prior to opening an issue for a bug report we encourage you to raise the issue on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/T5nhwPMSsJ) or start a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/CordEngine/discussions)for feedback to ensure that the behavior you are experiencing is a bug and not a simple configuration or syntax issue.

#### Submitting a Bug Report

Once you are sure that you have found a bug or error, please raise a bug report on GitHub.

- Open open an [issue](https://github.com/cordengine/core/issues/new/choose).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will review the issue and attempt to reproduce the issue with your provided steps.
- If the issue is confirmed the issue will be labeled for development at which time you can submit a PR with a fix if you desire.
- The the team can not reproduce the issue, they will ask for more information. Please make sure to respond to any follow up questions in the issue.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We use GitHub issues and projects to track feature requests. Before requesting a new feature, please make sure it is not already on the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/CordEngine/projects/3) or [already suggested](https://github.com/CordEngine/core/issues?q=label%3A%22🦄+type%3A+feature%22+). If not then please open a new [feature request issue](https://github.com/cordengine/core/issues/new/choose)
